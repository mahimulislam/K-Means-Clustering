# K-Means-Clustering

Problem Description: 
1. Take input from the given source data file and plot all the points. 
2. Perform the k-means clustering algorithm applying Euclidean distance as a distance measure on the given dataset with k=2. 
3. Color the corresponding points on the clusters with different colors.
Try to generalize your code as much as possible. 
Take random points from the given data as initial centroids.
